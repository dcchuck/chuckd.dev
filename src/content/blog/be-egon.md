# Be Egon

## To the Point

It is helpful to think of AI tooling some universal approximator. With that, point to your input before pointing to the tool when results are not as expected.

"Garbage in, garbage out" as they say. Therefore, "perfect in, perfect out"? Obviously if you have the perfect solution already you would not seek to improve it - but let's focus on something close to "perfect". If there *is* an input that can yield "perfect" output, your task is to devise that input.

Finally - I support the use of AI tooling to generate this input. Decompose your problems.

## With Humor

I wouldn't call myself a "movie person", but I am one to compare things to moments in cinema. It allows me to reminisce while also communicating a point, though that's not always the best. There's always a chance the person you're speaking to hasn't seen the film. Or perhaps their interpretation of the scene doesn't match mine.

With that, I'll pull in my reference to 1984's "Ghostbusters".

The movie stars 3 scientists working at Columbia University, researching paranormal activity. The 3 scientists consist of Egon (the pragmatic, tool-centric one), Ray (slightly more of a dreamer than Egon, but similar), and Peter (the charlatan - he's in this for a paycheck and doesn't seem to respect science like the others). Not all to unlikely of a crew I would say.

After years of nothing, they finally stumble upon a real ghost at the New Your Public Library of all places in an iconic opening scene that brings their years of research to the forefront.

They go into business for themselves. Their first job? They're after a green floating blob fans would come to know as "Slimer" in a luxury hotel meant to not be too far from the library. And this is where it happens.

The crew assembles in an elevator, geared up with very complex machinery we come to learn is capable of more or less total destruction. It's in this moment where they have a startling realization.

```
Ray: You know, it just occurred to me that we really haven't had a successful test of this equipment.

Egon: I blame myself.

Peter: So do I.
```

While on paper that reads as though Peter also blames himself, I've always taken it to be him blaming Egon. A debate for Comic Con I suppose. That's not what we're here for though. We're here for Egon.

In that moment that moment, chasing a solution to a problem that arguably only existed in their minds until that infamous day in the library, things were not perfect. There are many reasons why - but immediately our hero chimes in - I blame myself.

In the movie they just keeping moving on of course. Everything goes well. There's a giant marshmallow man that attacks New York City - but ultimately this previously unproven technology prevails.

We don't care about that part of the story. We're here for courageously pointing at yourself when things aren't perfect. You can always blame someone (or something) else. "It's a poor carpenter who blames his tools" as they say.

In the case of Agentic software development, we take this lesson to our inputs. What did you give the agent?

And when the agent fails?

I blame myself.
